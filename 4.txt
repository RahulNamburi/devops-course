Later I joined a company called Xavvy Software solution. It's a consulting company 

And then I moved to a company called ICON TILES from the ICON SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS PRIVATE LIMITED group.

Icon tiles is a Startup eCommerce site in the UK

We worked on the Strategy of sales, Digital marketing, Procuring tiles from Morbi, On imports and exports, web development, using the AWS as the mainstream, and Magento tool as the E-commerce site.

This is all about myself and my career for the past 2.5 years..
